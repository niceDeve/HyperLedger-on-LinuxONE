# HyperLedger on LinuxONE
**WORK IN PROGRESS** Install and Use on Hyperledger Fabric on LinuxONE Community Cloud 

IBM is a part of Hyperledger, a global, collaborative effort to advance blockchain technology, hosted by The Linux Foundation.Hyperledger has several open-source projects including Hyperledger Fabricand Hyperledger Composer.The Hyperledger Fabric project is one of several Hyperledger projects that implement distributed-ledger technology solutions.  Others are Hyperledger Sawtooth Lake, Hyperledger Irohaand Hyperledger Burrow.

There are several other Hyperledger projects that do not directly implement distributed-ledger technology, but rather offer complementary functionality to enhance the value of a distributed-ledger technology solution.  Hyperledger Composer is one such project.  

Hyperledger Composer is a collaboration tool for building blockchain business networks, accelerating the development of smart contracts and their deployment across a distributed ledger.This lab discusses Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric.  For more information on these or any of the other Hyperledger projects please see https://www.hyperledger.org.
